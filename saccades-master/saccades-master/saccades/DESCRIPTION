Description: Functions for detecting eye fixations in raw eye-tracking
    data.  The detection is done using a velocity-based algorithm for
    saccade detection proposed by Ralf Engbert and Reinhold Kliegl in
    2003.  The algorithm labels segments as saccades when the velocity of
    the eye movement exceeds a certain threshold.  Anything between two
    saccades is considered a fixation.  Thus the algorithm is not
    appropriate for data containing episodes of smooth pursuit eye
    movements.
